# GadsbyAuthor
A simple project to automate playing a game called Gadsby

Gadsby is a game created by Tias Webster and Ben Hannel. 
It is based on a book by Ernest Wright by the same name.
In Gadsby, you must speak normally and say what you would normally say, but without using any words that contain the letter E.

GadsbyAuthor contains 2 classes whereby the user can enter text and the program will automagically try to replace its text
with words (synonyms from Big Huge Thesaurus) that do not contain the letter E.

It rarely works, but it's always entertaining.
